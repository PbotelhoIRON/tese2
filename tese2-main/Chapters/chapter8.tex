\chapter{Tool Design for Blade Clearance Control}
\label{cha:toolclear}


Following the conclusions drawn in Section~\ref{cha:contacto} regarding the actual contact points between blade platforms, this chapter focuses on applying reverse engineering to determine the chord length of the blade platforms and . The approach involves analyzing the contact zones identified previously and determine the correct platform chord dimensions. Furthermore, the diameters of the spool will be determined by opening a case with the manufacturer to request these specific dimensions, ensuring accuracy in the assembly process.

With this information, the chapter proceeds to the design of a tool for blade clearance control, capable of assessing the contact clearance between the blades during assembly. The tool will be designed based on nominal tolerances, estimated blade configurations, and the dimensional analysis of the spool diameter, ensuring precise control over the final assembly clearance.


\section{Statistical Analysis for Tolerance Estimation}

The first step in this process is determining how many blades need to be measured in order to obtain a credible and accurate chord dimension. 
To assess this, a statistical methodology was applied. Since no manufacturing tolerances were provided, these were estimated based on direct measurements performed with a caliper. 
The approach is grounded in standard principles of statistical quality control and process capability analysis, as detailed in Requeijo and Pereira's work on process planning and statistical control.

\subsection{Sampling Strategy}

Building upon the methodology, the next step is to determine the number of blades to be measured from each stage to ensure reliable results. 
A pilot sample was used to estimate the required number of measurements for process characterization.
Six used blades were measured per stage using a digital caliper. The results for stages 6 to 10 are presented in Table~\ref{tab:pilot_measurements}.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:corda}, the dimension "x" represents the chord length being measured on the blade platform.

Using this data, the required sample size \(n\) for a given confidence level of and measurement precision was determined using the expression:

\[
n = \left( \frac{Z \cdot s}{E} \right)^2
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(Z\): standard normal value for the chosen confidence level (in this case 1.96 for 95\% of confidence),
    \item \(s\): standard deviation estimated from the pilot sample,
    \item \(E\): maximum acceptable error (typically set to 0.01 mm, matching the caliper's resolution).
\end{itemize}

The values of \(s\) and the corresponding sample sizes for each stage are presented in Table~\ref{tab:sample_sizes_data} for the narrow body type blades and on Table~\ref{tab:sample_sizes_data_wide} for the wide body type blades.

Regarding the number of measurements per blade, only one measurement was taken per blade. 
This choice is justified by the high resolution of the caliper, which is calibrated, and the repeatability of the measurement procedure, with measurements consistently performed by a single operator. 
According to principles described in the literature, and particularly by Requeijo and Pereira, when the measurement system is precise and the method is consistent, a single measurement per part is acceptable in statistical process control. 
Repeated measurements are mostly recommended when evaluating the measurement system itself (e.g., during a repeatability and reproducibility study).

\subsection{Estimating Process Tolerance}

Knowing the number of measurements needed per stage, the following step is measuring new \gls{HPC} blades available on \gls{TAP}'s engine shop.
For each blade group, the sample mean \(\bar{x}\) and standard deviation \(s\) were computed. Assuming normality in the data distribution, the process tolerance can estimated as:

\[
T = 6s
\]

According to literature this range is expected to encompass approximately 99.73\% of blades, reflecting a standard tolerance interval associated with normally distributed processes.

Example for wide blades from stage 7:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Measurements: \{20.62, 20.62, 20.61, 20.62, 20.62, 20.62, 20.61\} mm
    \item Mean: \(\bar{x} = 20.6171\) mm
    \item Standard deviation: \(s = 0.00488\) mm
    \item Tolerance estimate: \(T = 0.02928\) mm
\end{itemize}

Tables~\ref{tab:mean_tolerance_narrow} and~\ref{tab:mean_tolerance_wide} present all the measurement results and estimated tolerances for each stage.

As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:desafios}, the tolerance allowed for each blade at each stage, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:clearance}, is always larger than the tolerance estimated in this chapter, making it a solid and admissible estimation.
Thus, it can be also concluded that the nominal chord length of the blade platform corresponds to the mean value presented in the tables.

Considering the mass production of these blades, and as previously mentioned, these tolerances must be analyzed through the statistical method. This approach assumes that the measurements of a specific dimension within a batch of parts follow a normal distribution. By analyzing, for example, an engine assembled in the workshop, and considering the number of wide and narrow blades per stage, it is possible to assess the potential dimensional variation of the blade set. The number of blades assembled per stage, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:number_of_blades}, provides a clear overview of the blade distribution, which is essential for understanding the dimensional variability in the assembly process."

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{equation}
\text{TolC} = \sqrt{T_N^2 \cdot N + T_W^2 \cdot W}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \label{eq:tolc}
    \item \( T_N \) is the tolerance associated with narrow blades.
    \item \( N \) is the number of narrow blades.
    \item \( T_W \) is the tolerance associated with wide blades.
    \item \( W \) is the number of wide blades.
    \item \( \text{TolC} \) represents the total combined tolerance, taking into account the individual tolerances of both narrow and wide blades, as well as the number of blades of each type.
\end{itemize}

Applying equation~\ref{eq:tolc}, it is possible to evaluate whether the total dimensional variation at each stage remains within acceptable limits for the assembly process. 
Table~\ref{tab:dimensional variation} presents the calculated dimensional variation for each stage, showing a significant deviation in Stage 6, followed by substantially lower and consistent values in the subsequent stages, suggesting a stable manufacturing process.

\end{table}



To determine manufacturing tolerances, the manufacturing methods of the parts were analyzed to understand the limitations of the manufacturer. 
It was also considered whether other supplied parts, which are equally critical, have tighter tolerances and which IT levels correspond to these fundamental tolerances.

For example, regarding the \gls{LPT} shaft, although the manufacturing dimensions are not available, the operational limits for the parts provided by the manufacturer are known. 
For this part, the inner diameters have operational tolerances of 0.004 mm, which implies that the manufacturing tolerances must be tighter to ensure the part remains operational. 
Assuming a safety coefficient of 2, a manufacturing tolerance of 0.002 mm can be assumed. 
By analyzing the table of fundamental tolerances and considering that this diameter falls within the range of 180 mm to 250 mm, it corresponds to an IT01 classification, the minimal tolerance for such dimensions. 
This highlights the level of manufacturing precision that the producer is capable of.


\subsection{Conversion from Chord to Arc}

Before defining the dimensions of the blade clearance control tool, it is essential to convert the measured platform chord length into the corresponding arc length, as the actual contact between the blades occurs along the circumference of the engine's spool perimeter.

Assuming a circular geometry, the relation between the chord \(c\), arc length \(a\), and radius \(R\) is given by:

\[
a = R \cdot \theta = 2R \cdot \arcsin\left( \frac{c}{2R} \right)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(c\): chord length of the platform,
    \item \(R\): radius of the stage perimeter,
    \item \(a\): arc length corresponding to that chord.
\end{itemize}

In practice, for small angles and short chords the chord and arc are approximately equal. 
However, to ensure dimensional precision in the tool design, the arc length is computed using the actual measured chord and known stage radius.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Spool diameter Tolerancing}

In order to accurately define the measurement process of the blade platforms, it is also essential to consider the potential dimensional variation of the spool on which the blades are mounted. 
Since this component is not readily available in large quantities at the TAP engine maintenance facility, only two spools were available throughout the course of this dissertation. 
The measurements were taken on the blade platform side of the spool, specifically in the region where blade-to-blade contact occurs, as illustrated in Figure~5.3 and referred to as the Diameter Up.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Spool measurements for engines 418 and 463}
    \label{tab:spool_measurements}
    \begin{tabular}{cc|cc}
        \hline
        \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{in}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{mm}} \\
        \textbf{418} & \textbf{463} & \textbf{418} & \textbf{463} \\
        \hline
        15.550 & 15.550 & 394.970  & 394.970  \\
        15.615 & 15.615 & 396.621  & 396.621  \\
        15.677 & 15.677 & 398.1958 & 398.1958 \\
        15.704 & 15.705 & 398.8816 & 398.9070 \\
        15.690 & 15.688 & 398.5260 & 398.4752 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Given that only two components were available, it was not possible to carry out a statistical analysis similar to the one performed for the blades. As such, a fundamental tolerance grade was assumed to define the dimensional variation of the spool, based on tolerances applied to diameter-related dimensions in other critical components.

For example, in the case of the \gls{LPT} shaft, although the exact manufacturing dimensions are not available, the operational limits provided by the manufacturer are known. For this part, the inner diameters have an operational tolerance of 0.004 mm, which implies that the manufacturing tolerance must be even tighter to ensure the part remains functional under operating conditions. Assuming a safety factor of 2, a manufacturing tolerance of 0.002 mm can be considered reasonable.

By consulting the table of fundamental tolerances and noting that this diameter falls within the range of 180 mm to 250 mm, it corresponds to an IT01 grade, the tightest standard tolerance for that size range. This demonstrates the high level of manufacturing precision achievable by the supplier.

Taking this into account, it is reasonable to adopt an IT grade for the spool diameter in order to address the dimensional variation in the absence of a sufficiently large sample size. By assuming an IT3 classification, which is considerably less strict than the tolerance estimated for the \gls{LPT} shaft, the spool diameters can be associated with a manufacturing tolerance of approximately 0.013 mm.

The corresponding nominal dimensions and assumed tolerances are presented in Table~\ref{tab:spool_nominal_tolerance}.
